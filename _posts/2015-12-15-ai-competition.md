There was an <a href="http://russianaicup.ru/">AI competition</a> this December. The task was to program autonomous racing cars in the simulator, so your car would come first in racing. I went through the first round but stuck later. My solution was developed on python and was a bit slow, my people were much more efficient in C++, but I assume they also had a better strategy. While doing this task I skimmed through pretty advanced <a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/artificial-intelligence-for-robotics--cs373">course on Udacity</a> about autonomous cars and applied A* algorithm in my solution.  

Here you can see my algorithm in action (My nikname - Rumbo):
